# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code.

I have never successfully complete the challenge... perhaps 2019 is my year?

## Setup

You know the drill...

```bash
yarn
```

## Generate a new solution from a template

```bash
YEAR=20XX DAY=0X yarn new
```

## Display the output for a solution

```bash
YEAR=20XX DAY=0X yarn solve
```
